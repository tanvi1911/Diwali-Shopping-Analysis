<h1>Diwali Shopping Data Analysis</h1>
<h3>Overview<h3>
In this project, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Diwali shopping data to gain insights into consumer behavior and trends during the festival season. Diwali is a major festival in India, and it is known for its shopping and gift-giving traditions. Therefore, analyzing Diwali shopping data can provide valuable insights into consumer preferences, trends, and behaviors.
